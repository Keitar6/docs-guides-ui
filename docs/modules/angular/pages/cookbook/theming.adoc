[#overview]
== Overview
Starting with version 6 of OneCX, new theming mechanisms were introduce in order to:

* fulfill the need for a common theme within pages
* allow to style each application in isolation

[#theme-variables]
== Theme variables
Theme variables are still accessible from any application. Whenever a workspace is accessed, Shell is going to update the theme used on a page so it matches the current workspace. This will result in the following variables to be accessible in any component:

[#theme-overrides]
== Theme overrides
Theme mechanism is based on the PrimeNG theming. However, in OneCX it is possible to style the content differently per Application. The mechanism that allows that is called theme overrides. Each Mfe or Remote Component can specify their overrides that will guarantee that certain styles are applied differently than in other applications on the page.

[#appropriate-scenarios]
=== Appropriate Scenarios
This feature should be used when the application wants to control the style of:

* PrimeNG components
* OneCX components

[#usage-instructions]
=== Usage instructions
To use this feature, its required to add the options object as an argument to the `provideThemeConfig` call. This argument should have a property called `overrides` that can be one of the following:

* Object with defined overrides
* Promise that resolves with defined overrides
* Function that returns one of the above

The object containing overrides should have the same structure as https://primeng.org/theming#definepreset[PrimeNG's presets]. The presets can contain general variables like primary color or surface color, but its also possible to define customizations for components.

Each PrimeNG component specifies a list of design tokens (e.g., https://v18.primeng.org/button#Buttonclasses[button component design tokens]). Those can be used to override certain styles of each component.

[#examples]
=== Examples

Overriding the primary color with static values::
```
const primary = {
    50: '#ecfeff',
    100: '#cffafe',
    200: '#a5f3fc',
    300: '#67e8f9',
    400: '#22d3ee',
    500: '#06b6d4',
    600: '#0891b2',
    700: '#0e7490',
    800: '#155e75',
    900: '#164e63',
    950: '#083344',
}
provideThemeConfig({
  overrides: {
    semantic: {
      primary: primary,
      colorScheme: {
        light: {
            primary: primary
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Overriding the form field focus border color with token value::
```
provideThemeConfig({
  overrides: {
    semantic: {
      colorScheme: {
        light: {
            formField: {
                focusBorderColor: '{primary.600}',
            }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```
